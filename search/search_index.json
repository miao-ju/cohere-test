I have now spent a little bit of time playing with the Co:here API platform to learn a little more about the products, and familiarise myself with the product offerings. On this website, I provide a short overview of the endpoints that I've looked at and give a few short examples of how they could be used. </p> <p> All of the code is available on the github repository @miao-ju/cohere-test and is written entirely in Python. Once I have a little more time it would be fun to make a few React components to call the API interactively from this site! </p> <p> Note: I have used the Co:here trial API key for this, and will likely remove the contents of this website in the coming weeks. It is simply meant to act as a short demonstration of what is possible with the Co:here API platform. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> Classify      //      RAG Chat      //      Summarize </p>"},{"location":"classify/","title":"Classification","text":"<p>Cohere provides a simple end-point for @classification.

Our website is doing well and the number of customer queries we have to deal with is becoming unmanageable. Instead of hiring an external team to deal with this, we can provide common solutions to the user automatically.</p> <p>First, we define a few different classes in which the queries may lie:</p> <pre><code>import cohere\nimport enum\n\n\nclass eSupportOption(str, enum.Enum):\n  ACCOUNT = 'Change account settings'\n  SUBSCRIPTION = 'Manage subscription service'\n  INFORMATION = 'Show company information'\n  HUMAN_CONTACT = 'Chat with a human'\n</code></pre> <p>note, we have also included an option to talk to a human if the user requests it. Next, we define a few examples which can be used in our classification. These could be based on past interactions with customers which make these particularly easy to generate. We could provide something like:</p> <pre><code>from cohere.responses.classify import Example\n\nexamples = [\n  Example('How can I update my password?', eSupportOption.ACCOUNT),\n  Example('I would like to change my shipping address.', eSupportOption.ACCOUNT),\n  Example('Can I request all of the information you have on me?', eSupportOption.ACCOUNT),\n  Example('How can I create an account for the website?', eSupportOption.ACCOUNT),\n  #,\n  Example('Can I cancel my subscription?', eSupportOption.SUBSCRIPTION),\n  Example('How can I change my monthly subscription?', eSupportOption.SUBSCRIPTION),\n  Example('Is there an option to change the frequency of my deliveries?', eSupportOption.SUBSCRIPTION),\n  Example('Can I get coffee delivered every month?', eSupportOption.SUBSCRIPTION),\n  #,\n  Example('How long has this company existed?', eSupportOption.INFORMATION),\n  Example('How quickly should I consume my coffee once it has arrived?', eSupportOption.INFORMATION),\n  Example('Where do you source your coffee from?', eSupportOption.INFORMATION),\n  Example('Do you sell seasonal varieties of coffee?', eSupportOption.INFORMATION),\n  #,\n  Example('How could I contact a human here?', eSupportOption.HUMAN_CONTACT),\n  Example('None of your support options are what I need.', eSupportOption.HUMAN_CONTACT),\n  Example('Is there an email address or phone number for the company?', eSupportOption.HUMAN_CONTACT),\n  Example('My order never arrived.', eSupportOption.HUMAN_CONTACT),\n]\n</code></pre> <p>All we have to do now is to send these examples, along with a question, to the @classify end-point, and we will receive an estimate for which class the question belongs to:</p> <pre><code>import credentials\nco = cohere.Client(credentials.COHERE_API_KEY)\n\nquestions_to_classify = ['Can I update my monthly payment method?', 'Do you sell natural coffee?']\n\nresponse = co.classify(\n  inputs=questions_to_classify,\n  examples=examples,\n)\n</code></pre> <p>... and with some manipulation of the structure of the response, we get something like:</p> <pre><code>Question asked: Can I update my monthly payment method?\n        Prediction: ['Manage subscription service']\n        Confidence: [0.8488362]\n        Labels:\n                Change account settings=LabelPrediction(confidence=0.14907078)\n                Chat with a human=LabelPrediction(confidence=0.0010854176)\n                Manage subscription service=LabelPrediction(confidence=0.8488362)\n                Show company information=LabelPrediction(confidence=0.0010076427)\n\nQuestion asked: Do you sell natural coffee?\n        Prediction: ['Show company information']\n        Confidence: [0.99629194]\n        Labels:\n                Change account settings=LabelPrediction(confidence=0.0005747885)\n                Chat with a human=LabelPrediction(confidence=0.001953109)\n                Manage subscription service=LabelPrediction(confidence=0.0011801493)\n                Show company information=LabelPrediction(confidence=0.99629194)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cv/","title":"StabilityAI: Stable Animation","text":"<ul> <li>Role: Technical Product Manager</li> <li>Led an international team, successfully transitioning Stable Animation from a research project to a market-ready product as the exclusive product manager.

Breaking our documents down into snippets requires a little extra work, but ultimtately allows for more specific citations. Providing each of the snippets with an informative title ensures we can always trace the quoted citation back to the source. Given the simplicity of our raw data, we can use a simple function to produce a list of snippets from each document:</p> <pre><code>from pathlib import Path\n\n\ndef produce_document(title: str, path: Path) -&gt; list[dict[str, str]]:\n\n    with open(path, 'r') as f:\n        content = f.read()\n\n    content = content.split('\\n\\n')\n\n    documents = []\n    for c in content:\n        subtitle, *subcontents = c.split('\\n')\n        subcontents = '; '.join(subcontents)\n\n        subtitle = subtitle.replace('# ', '')\n        subcontents = subcontents.replace('- ', '')\n\n        _doc = dict(title=f'{title}: {subtitle}', snippet=subcontents)\n        documents.append(_doc)\n\n    return documents\n</code></pre> <p>In the process of experimenting with the @chat API, it appears that using both the job descrition and CV as documents for RAG was counter productive.

In order to avoid this, the CV is provided as a RAG document, and the job description is provided in the preamble.
