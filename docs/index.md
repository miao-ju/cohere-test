<p style="text-align: justify; width: 80%;"">
Hello! I have now spent a little bit of time playing with the Co:here API platform to learn a little more about the products, and familiarise myself with the product offerings. On this website, I provide a short overview of the endpoints that I've looked at and give a few short examples of how they could be used.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; width: 80%;">
All of the code is available on the github repository <a href="https://github.com/miao-ju/cohere-test">@miao-ju/cohere-test</a> and is written entirely in Python. Once I have a little more time it would be fun to make a few React components to call the API interactively from this site!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; width: 80%;">
Note: I have used the Co:here trial API key for this, and will likely remove the contents of this website in the coming weeks. It is simply meant to act as a short demonstration of what is possible with the Co:here API platform.
